        <p><b>Version control systems (VCS)</b> are essential tools that help track changes in files (usually source code)
over time. They allow multiple people to collaborate on projects, keep a history of modifications, and
revert to earlier versions when needed. This reading guide will walk you through the <b>history of version
control</b> – from its early centralized beginnings to today’s distributed systems – and highlight <b>modern
trends</b> shaping how we use version control.</p>
