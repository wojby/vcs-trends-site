        <h1 align = "center">Historical Evolution of Version Control Systems</h1>

        <ul>
        <p><li><i>1972</i>: <b>Source Code Control System (SCCS)</b> – one of the first version control systems, developed
at Bell Labs, which introduced the basic idea of tracking changes (initially used on IBM
mainframes).</li></p>

<p><li><i>1982</i>: <b>Revision Control System (RCS)</b> – released by Walter Tichy at Purdue University, RCS
automated change tracking for individual files using delta storage (storing differences between
file versions) . RCS was a local VCS (no network support), handling one file at a time</li></p>

<p><li><i>1986</i>: <b>Concurrent Versions System (CVS)</b> – developed by Dick Grune as a front-end to RCS, CVS
allowed collaboration on whole projects with a client-server model . It added networked
repositories and concurrent multi-developer capabilities to RCS. CVS became widely used in the
1990s for open-source and commercial projects, despite limitations (e.g. non-atomic commits
and tricky branching).</li></p>

<p><li><i>2000</i>: <b>Subversion (SVN)</b> – created by CollabNet as a successor to CVS, Subversion improved on
CVS’s weaknesses. SVN introduced atomic commits (all-or-nothing changesets), better handling
of file renames, and more efficient network operations. By ~2006, SVN had become one of the
most popular VCS tools, addressing many of CVS’s shortcomings . SVN was still
centralized: a single repository stored the code, and developers committed to that central server</li></p>

<p><li><i>2005</i>: <b>Git</b> and <b>Mercurial</b> – a breakthrough year for version control. In 2005, after the Linux
kernel’s commercial VCS (BitKeeper) license was revoked, Linus Torvalds created Git as a new
distributed VCS for the kernel . Around the same time, Matt Mackall released Mercurial. Both
Git and Mercurial are distributed version control systems (DVCS), meaning every user has a
full copy of the repository. Git quickly became the dominant VCS of the two – by 2019 it was
estimated to have ~80% market share vs. ~2% for Mercurial . (We’ll discuss distributed vs.
centralized concepts more in a moment.)</li></p>

<p><li><i>2008</i>: <b>GitHub launched</b> – GitHub provided a web-based collaboration platform on top of Git. It
made sharing code and participating in projects easier with features like pull requests, issue
tracking, and social networking for developers. GitHub (and later similar services like Bitbucket
and GitLab) greatly accelerated Git’s adoption across the industry.</li></p>

<p><li><i>2010s</i>: <b>Wide adoption of Git and migration from older systems</b> – Throughout the 2010s, many
teams and open-source projects migrated from CVS, SVN, or other tools to Git. Even companies
that had used centralized systems (like Microsoft’s TFS or Perforce) moved toward Git-based
workflows. Distributed version control became the new standard for most software
development.</li></p>

<p><li><i>Late 2010s</i>: <b>GitOps and modern practices</b> – In 2017, the term GitOps was introduced by
Weaveworks, highlighting an approach to use Git repositories as the single source of truth for
infrastructure and deployments (more on this later) . Integration of VCS with Continuous
Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines became mainstream, and cloud-hosted VCS
platforms grew in popularity.</li></p>

<p><li><i>2020s</i>: <b>AI and large-scale collaboration</b> – Recent years have seen cloud platforms for VCS reach
massive scale (e.g. as of 2023 GitHub reported over 100 million developers using its platform
). Artificial intelligence is also beginning to assist in code management and review (with tools
like GitHub Copilot and AI-driven code review assistants). Version control remains central to
modern DevOps workflows, enabling everything from open-source projects with thousands of
contributors to automated infrastructure management via GitOps.</li></p>

<h2 align = "center">Comparing Major VCS Tools and Their Use Cases
Over time, various VCS tools have been created, each suited to certain use cases and project sizes.
Here’s a comparison of some historically significant systems: </h2>

<ul>

    <p><li><b>RCS (Revision Control System)</b>: Local system for single files. Simple, now obsolete.</li></p>

    <p><li><b>CVS (Concurrent Versions System)</b>: Centralized client-server for small-to-medium teams.
           Lacked robust features like atomic commits and strong merging, which lead to difficulties in larger projects. Not used often today.</li></p>

    <p><li><b>Subversion (SVN)</b>: Centralized system that improved upon CVS with atomic commits and better branching/merging.
           Very popular in mid-2000s and still in use for some legacy projects, though branching can be clumsy on very large teams.</li></p>

    <p><li><b>Git</b>: The distributed system that is now the standard.
           Highly flexible and extremely fast at branching and merging, making it ideal for projects of any scale, especially open-source and modern DevOps.</li></p>

    <p><li><b>Mercurial</b>: Another powerful distributed system, similar to Git but known for a more straightforward command set.
           Did not achieve Git's widespread adoption due to the network effect of platforms like GitHub.</li></p>

    <p><h3 align = "center">Summarizing, while earlier centralized tools like CVS and SVN provided basic versioning and improved reliability, Git now dominates the industry due to its performance, flexibility,
           and robust ecosystem, with the core difference being centralized vs. distributed workflows.</h3></p>
</ul>

<h1 align = "center">DVCS revolution</h1>

<p><b><i>Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)</b></i>, like <b>Git</b>, revolutionized development by enabling:</p>

<ul>
    <p><li><b>Lightweight branching and merging</b>: Developers can easily create branches, work independently, and merge changes without much overhead, encouraging flexible, non-linear workflows.</li></p>
    <p><li><b>Offline work</b>: Developers can commit, branch, and merge locally, only needing to sync with others when online.</li></p>
    <p><li><b>Decentralization</b>: Every developer has a full copy of the repository, offering redundancy and resilience, removing the single point of failure seen in Centralized Version Control (CVCS).</li></p>
    <p><li><b>Faster operations</b>: Most actions (commits, diffs, logs) are done locally, making them faster and not reliant on network connectivity.</li></p>
    <p><li><b>Flexible collaboration</b>: Forking and peer-to-peer interactions make collaboration smoother, especially for open-source projects or decentralized teams.</li></p>
</ul>
