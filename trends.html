        <h2>GitOps: Version Control Meets DevOps</h2>

        <p><b>GitOps</b> is a relatively new approach (coined around 2017) that applies version control to operations and
infrastructure. The idea is to treat infrastructure configuration and deployment scripts as code in a
Git repository, and to use Git workflows (commits, pull requests) to manage changes to those
configurations. In a GitOps workflow, you might have a repository that defines, say, all your cloud
infrastructure or Kubernetes cluster configuration in declarative files (YAML, etc.). Any change to your
infrastructure is done by pushing a change to these files in Git, which then triggers an automated
deployment process to apply the change</p>
